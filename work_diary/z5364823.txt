Week 1 

We formed the group of 4 people and setup jira as required. 
We also decided to have an additional regular meeting every Saturday night. 
We delegated some tasks of the proposal, Leanna and Sunnie will be working on the user stories, 
while Trinh and me will be working on the background.

Week 2

We have roughly completed the background research, user stories, and defined both the normal 
and novel functionalities. We have then divided the remaining tasks. Leanna and Sunnie will 
be working on the storyboard, while Trinh and I will be working on the rest of Part B.
